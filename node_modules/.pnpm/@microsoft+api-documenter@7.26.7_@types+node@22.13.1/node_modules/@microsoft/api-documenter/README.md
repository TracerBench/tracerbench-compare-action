# @microsoft/api-documenter

This tool can be used to generate an online API reference manual for your TypeScript library.
It reads the *.api.json data files produced by [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/),
and then generates files in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) or
[DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) format.

For usage information, see the
[Generating Docs](https://api-extractor.com/pages/setup/generating_docs/) article from the API Extractor
documentation.
